# Scenario

## Overview

For the last year, I have been working as a junior cloud security analyst at Cymbal Retail. Cymbal Retail is a market powerhouse currently operating 170 physical stores and an online platform across 28 countries. They reported $15 billion in revenue in 2022 and currently employ 80,400 employees worldwide.

Cymbal Retail boasts a vast customer base with a multitude of transactions happening daily on their online platform. The organization is committed to the safety and security of its customers, employees, and assets, ensuring that its operations meet internal and external regulatory compliance expectations in all the countries it operates in.

## Incident Overview

One morning, the security team detects unusual activity within their systems. Further investigation into this activity quickly reveals that the company has suffered a massive security breach across its applications, networks, systems, and data repositories. Attackers gained unauthorized access to sensitive customer information, including credit card data, and personal details. This incident requires immediate attention and thorough investigation.

As a junior member of the security team, I will help support the security team through the lifecycle of this security incident.

## Action Plan

### 1. Identify Vulnerabilities
- Examine the vulnerabilities and findings in Google Cloud Security Command Center.

### 2. Isolate and Contain
- Shut the old VM down and create a new VM from a snapshot.

### 3. Revoke Public Access
- Revoke public access to the storage bucket and switch to uniform bucket-level access control.

### 4. Limit Firewall Access
- Limit the firewall ports access and fix the firewall rules.

### 5. Verify Remediation
- Run a report to verify the remediation of the vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, I aim to identify the vulnerabilities related to the breach, isolate and contain the breach to prevent further unauthorized access, recover the compromised systems, remediate any outstanding compliance-related issues, and verify compliance with frameworks.
